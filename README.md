**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This repository is outdated, check out my 2.0 repository here: [threadedtraceroute](https:://www.github.com/KaliKiu/threadedtraceroute) 

## Current Focus
- **Better handling of waiting times and scalability**  
- **Improving maintainability of code**  
- **Developing packet parser as well as packet trace analysis**
- **Adding cmake for userfriendlyness and testing**

For better maintainability, version 2.0 will focus on threaded packet tracing as well as external process data saving to significantly improve runtime performance for large-scale operations."
